# PerfectlyNormalUnity
Helper classes for unity development

---------------------------------

This is meant to be classes that you can reference into your unity project

Copy this dll from:
PerfectlyNormalUnity\bin\Debug\netstandard2.0\PerfectlyNormalUnity.dll

To anywhere under your unity Assets folder (I like to make a lib folder)

Then any class that you want to use this from needs a using statment at the top:
using PerfectlyNormalUnity;

---------------------------------

The easiest way to add new code to this project is to develop and test it in a unity project.  Then when you have it the way you want, copy into this solution

If there is a new reference needed, just select the type (from your unity project), hit F12 and the top of the generated file tells what dll that type came from
